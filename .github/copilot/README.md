# GitHub Copilot Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for customizing GitHub Copilot behavior in the AI3 project.

## Files in this Directory

- **copilot-config.json**: Main configuration file with settings for code completion behavior
- **project-context.md**: Project overview, tech stack and coding standards
- **ignore-patterns.md**: Patterns for files that should be ignored by Copilot
- **code-examples.md**: Example code patterns for Copilot to follow
- **ml-architecture.md**: Documentation on the ML model architecture

## How Copilot Uses These Files

GitHub Copilot will analyze these files to better understand:

1. The project's structure and purpose
2. Code style preferences
3. Architecture patterns to follow
4. ML concepts specific to this project

## Updating Configuration

When making significant changes to the project architecture or coding standards:

1. Update the relevant files in this directory
2. Ensure examples match the current project patterns
3. Keep the ML architecture documentation in sync with implementation
