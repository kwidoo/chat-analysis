# Task 6: Queue Monitoring Dashboard

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive queue monitoring system that provides real-time visibility into task processing status, health metrics, and historical performance data.

## Requirements

### Backend Implementation

1. **Queue Status API Endpoints**
   - Create a dedicated `/api/queue` blueprint for queue management endpoints
   - Implement `/api/queue/status` endpoint to return detailed queue statistics
   - Implement `/api/queue/tasks` endpoint with pagination and filtering
   - Add `/api/queue/task/<task_id>` endpoint for detailed task information
   - Implement `/api/queue/metrics` endpoint for historical queue performance data

2. **Queue Metrics Collection**
   - Extend QueueService to collect performance metrics:
     - Processing time statistics (min, max, avg)
     - Throughput (tasks/minute)
     - Error rates
     - Resource utilization
   - Store metrics in a time-series format for trend analysis
   - Implement periodic aggregation for long-term storage

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Implement automated alerts for queue backlogs
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent queue overflow
   - Create health check endpoint for monitoring systems
   - Add rate limiting to prevent queue flooding

### Frontend Implementation

1. **Queue Dashboard**
   - Extend existing QueueStatus component with detailed statistics
   - Create interactive charts for visualizing queue performance
   - Implement real-time updates with WebSockets
   - Add filtering and search capabilities for tasks

2. **Task Management UI**
   - Create a task details view to inspect individual tasks
   - Implement task retry functionality
   - Add task cancellation capabilities
   - Create task dependency visualization

3. **Admin Controls**
   - Implement queue pause/resume functionality
   - Add worker scaling controls
   - Create manual task prioritization interface
   - Implement system notifications for critical queue events

## Success Criteria

1. Queue metrics are visible in real-time through a dashboard
2. Administrators can monitor and manage the task processing system
3. Historical performance data is available for trend analysis
4. System automatically detects and alerts on queue issues
5. Integration with the existing file processing pipeline is seamless

## Implementation Approach

Follow the existing patterns for service implementation and API design. Create a modular design that allows for future extension of monitoring capabilities without significant refactoring.
