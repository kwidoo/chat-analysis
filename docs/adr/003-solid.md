## ‚ú® Feature: Enforce and Expand SOLID Architecture Principles

### ‚úÖ Tasks

#### üì¶ S (Single Responsibility)

- [x] Split `app.py` into dedicated startup modules:
  - [x] Move queue worker logic to `services/queue_worker.py`
  - [x] Move API route logic to `routes/`
  - [x] Move app factory to `core/app_factory.py`
- [x] Ensure `services/*` contain only business logic; move utilities to `utils/` if needed

#### ü™ü O (Open/Closed Principle)

- [x] Refactor `ModelRegistry` and `IndexService` to support pluggable backends (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- [x] Create new file `backend/extensions/model_provider.py`: define `BaseModelProvider` interface and registerable provider classes
- [x] Implement model providers for Hugging Face (`huggingface_provider.py`) and OpenAI (`openai_provider.py`)

#### üß¨ L (Liskov Substitution Principle)

- [x] Add unit tests using mock `EmbeddingService` and `IndexService` implementations
- [x] Ensure all services can be replaced by mocks/fakes in tests using Duck Typing or ABCs
- [x] Implemented mock services in `tests/unit/services/test_auth_services.py`

#### üîå I (Interface Segregation Principle)

- [x] Split `AuthService` into:
  - [x] `UserService` (user CRUD and auth logic)
  - [x] `TokenService` (JWT creation/validation)
  - [x] `MFAService` (optional)
- [x] Define interfaces (or ABCs) for each and inject via DI container
- [x] Created composite service for backward compatibility

#### üß≠ D (Dependency Inversion Principle)

- [x] Refactor service consumers to depend on `interfaces/` definitions:
  - [x] Create `interfaces/auth.py`, `interfaces/index.py`, etc.
  - [x] Move actual implementations to `services/impl/`
- [x] Register interface bindings explicitly in `core/di_container.py`
- [x] Implemented dependency injection container with service management lifecycle

### üß™ Testing

- [x] Used dependency injection to swap service implementations in tests
- [x] Created test infrastructure for unit testing service components

### üìù Implementation Details

#### Single Responsibility Principle

Each service now has a single responsibility. For example, the monolithic AuthService was split into UserService (user management), TokenService (token management), and MFAService (multi-factor authentication). This makes the codebase easier to maintain, as changes to one aspect of the system won't affect others.

#### Open/Closed Principle

The system now uses a plugin architecture for embedding models. The ModelRegistry and ModelProviderRegistry allow adding new model providers without modifying existing code. This was demonstrated with both HuggingFace and OpenAI providers being implemented independently.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle

All interfaces can be substituted with mock implementations for testing, demonstrated in the auth services unit tests. This ensures components can be tested in isolation and new implementations can seamlessly replace existing ones.

#### Interface Segregation Principle

Services now use focused interfaces rather than broad ones. For example, auth-related functionality is now split across multiple interfaces like IUserService, ITokenService, and IMFAService. This allows clients to depend only on interfaces they actually need.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle

The DI container in `core/di_container.py` implements the Dependency Inversion Principle, allowing high-level modules to depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. This makes the system more flexible and enables better testing through dependency substitution.
